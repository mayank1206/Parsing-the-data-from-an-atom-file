# Parsing-the-data-from-an-atom-file
HTML parsing is basically: taking in HTML code and extracting relevant information like the title of the page, paragraphs in the page, headings in the page, links, bold text etc.
This project is done in my internship where I have to parse the data and organized it in SQL. Using that data and API which they provided. I have to download more data and organized and make a record of it.
Parsing and organizing the data is not easy because of its large size, different form, and language issues and lot of things also done to increase the security of Data.
